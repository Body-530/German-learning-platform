# The Disallow directive tells crawlers which parts of the site they should NOT crawl or index.
# It's crucial to list pages here that are sensitive or not meant for public search results (e.g., admin panels, login screens).

Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /login
Disallow: /signup
# You can add other private or sensitive paths here.

# The Allow directive is technically optional for the whole site (as everything is allowed by default), 
# but it provides clarity for the homepage and public sections.
Allow: /

# The Sitemap directive is the most important part for SEO, as it tells search engines 
# exactly where to find your sitemap file.
# Replace 'https://yourdomain.com' with your actual website address.
